This is a naive SQL for Database System course, ZJU.

Owned by BitterVan.

This code is open sourced, GPL license. So never copy this code in any of your course project.

I finally finish writing this, but some bugs are remaining, including managing the B+ tree index, and so on.

Some code are provided by Yiming Wang, and Xiaomeng Hu helped debug the B+ tree.

Maybe I'll try rebuild this later.

Feb 11, 2022. Start rebuilding.
